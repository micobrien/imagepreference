Implementation of a MATLAB-based automated system that orders a number of images of the Sydney Opera House from ‘best’ to ‘worst’ based on a number of subjective criteria created with respect to the ‘recognisability’ and ‘quality’ of an image. This process aimed to address the challenges and possibilities associated with mimicking subjective preference on images in an automated computer-based environment, which is a promising approach to a number of applications in the area of digital image processing. The proposed solution employs a number of techniques in morphological image processing, segmentation, feature detection, and image classification that attempt to mimic a list of criteria that were explicitly defined through human image ordering testing. An iterative development and testing approach led to successful ordering of the majority of images in a validation dataset, and the identification of key aspects and opportunities in achieving success in this area of digital image processing.
